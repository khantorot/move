            <section class="section">
                <h4>1. Definitions</h4>
                <p>These reasons for collecting and processing Personal Data determine and limit what Personal Data
                    we
                    collect and how we use it (section 3. below), how long we store it (section 4. below), who has
                    access to it (section 5. below) and what rights and other control mechanisms are available to
                    you as
                    a user (section 6. below).</p>
                <h4>3. The Types and Sources of Data We Collect</h4>
                <p>When setting up an Account, Valve will collect your email address and country of residence. You
                    are
                    also required to choose a user name and a password. The provision of this information is
                    necessary
                    to register a Steam User Account. During setup of your account, the account is automatically
                    assigned a number (the "Steam ID") that is later used to reference your user account without
                    directly exposing Personally Identifying Information about you. We do not require you to provide
                    or
                    use your real name for the setup of a Steam User Account.</p>
                <h4>4. How Long We Store Data</h4>
                <p>We will only store your information as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which the
                    information is collected and processed or — where the applicable law provides for longer storage
                    and
                    retention period — for the storage and retention period required by law. After that your
                    Personal
                    Data will be deleted, blocked or anonymized, as provided by applicable law.</p>
                <h4>5. Who Has Access to Data</h4>
                <p>Valve does not sell Personal Data. However, we may share or provide access to each of the
                    categories
                    of Personal Data we collect as necessary for the following business purposes.</p>

                <h4>6. Your Rights and Control Mechanisms</h4>
                <p>The data protection laws of the European Economic Area, California, and other territories grant
                    their
                    residents certain rights in relation to their Personal Data. While other jurisdictions may
                    provide
                    fewer statutory rights, we make the tools designed to exercise such rights available to our
                    customers worldwide.</p>
                <h4>7. Children</h4>
                <p>The minimum age to create a Steam User Account is 13. Valve will not knowingly collect Personal
                    Data
                    from children under this age. Where certain countries apply a higher age of consent for the
                    collection of Personal Data, Valve requires parental consent before a Steam User Account can be
                    created and Personal Data associated with it collected. Valve encourages parents to instruct
                    their
                    children to never give out personal information when online.</p>
                <h4>8. Contact Info</h4>
                <p>You can contact Valve's data protection officer at the address below.</p>
                <p>While we review any request sent by mail, please be aware that to combat fraud, harassment and
                    identity theft, the only way to access, rectify or delete your data is through logging in with
                    your
                    Steam User Account at http://help.steampowered.com and selecting the menu items -> My Account ->
                    View Account Data.</p>
                <h4>9. Additional Information for Users from the European Economic Area, U.K., and Switzerland</h4>
                <p>Although the EU-U.S Privacy Shield and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield have been ruled invalid as a
                    legal
                    basis for data transfers to the U.S., Valve and TR Technical Services Inc., its wholly-owned
                    U.S.
                    subsidiary (collectively "Valve") continue to comply with the Privacy Shield Principles with
                    respect
                    to any Personal Data transferred from the EU, UK, and Switzerland to the United States in
                    reliance
                    on the Privacy Shield. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the
                    Privacy Shield Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield
                    program, and to view our certification, please visit http://www.privacyshield.gov.
                </p>
                <h4>10. Additional Information for Users from California</h4>
                <p>The CCPA grants California residents certain privacy rights regarding the Personal Data we
                    collect.
                    We are committed to respecting these rights and complying with the CCPA. The following explains
                    these rights and Valve's practices with respect to them.</p>
                <p>Right to Know. Under the CCPA you have the right to request that we disclose to you what Personal
                    Data we collect, use, disclose, and sell.</p>
