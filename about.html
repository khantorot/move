                <h2>At Valve we make games, Steam, and hardware.</h2>
                <h4>Our games attract millions and define genres.</h4>
                <p>Valve's debut title, Half-Life, was released in 1998. It won more than 50 game of the year awards,
                    and PC Gamer even called it the Best PC Game Ever. Since then, we've released dozens of titles that
                    changed the world. Today, millions of people play our games every day.</p>
                <p>Our earlier titles were built on an innovative engine with world-class gameplay as their paramount
                    goal, and praised by critics as games that revitalized or even invented their genres.</p>

                <h2>What we do?</h2>
                <h4>Our platform connects players with the world's greatest entertainment.</h4>
                <p>We created Steam in 2003 to serve as a digital content distribution channel, before app stores
                    existed. It's since grown and evolved into a platform for thousands of creators and publishers to
                    deliver content and establish direct relationships with their customers. The Steam Community enables
                    millions of players to do likewise, sharing entertainment and ideas, and making friends.</p>
                <h4>Our hardware is a happiness delivery vehicle.</h4>
                <p>We make consumer electronic devices that improve gaming on the PC. Things like the Steam Controller
                    and the Steam Link. We invented the VR technologies that power the Vive, an interactive VR system
                    brought to market in partnership with HTC. Just as in software development, we conduct playtests and
                    share prototypes with our partners and players. We follow the results of this work all the way
                    through the manufacturing process to create products people are sure to enjoy.</p>

                <h2>Our office</h2>
                <h4>Boss-free since 1996.</h4>
                <p>We believe that the best product decisions are made by the people who are actually doing the work. We
                    take great pride in hiring top talent from a variety of disciplines and bringing people together
                    with one simple directive: Collaborate and create. Below are some of the people at Valve who do just
                    that.</p>
                <img src="./content/images/office.jpg" alt="office">
                <p>We make all of this stuff collaboratively in Bellevue, Washington, where we combine the resources and
                    talent of a world-class company with the ethos of a small startup. With an engaged and vocal
                    community of partners and players, our products and our company will continue to change and grow in
                    ways we may never have predicted. Join us, and help inform what's next.</p>
